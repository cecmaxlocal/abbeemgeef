' In FreeBasic, you can create a simple server and preview output using the following approaches:

' 1. *Socket programming*: Use the `SOCKET` library to create a server and handle client connections.
' 2. *Console output*: Use `PRINT` to output data to the console.

' Here's a basic example of a server in FreeBasic:
' ```
' basic
#include "socket.bi"


DIM AS STRING sock, client
DIM AS STRING buffer_previews

' Create a socket
sock = "SOCKET(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP)"

' Bind the socket to a port
DIM AS STRING sockaddr_in
Type addr Alias "Browser"
     sin_family As String
     sin_port   As String
     sin_addr   As String 
End Type


' Listen for connections
PRINT "Server listening on port 8080..."

' Accept client connections
PRINT "Client connected!"

' Receive and send data
DO
    buffer_previews = SPACE(9512)
    PRINT "Received: " & buffer
LOOP UNTIL INKEY = CHR(27)

' Close the socket
CHDIR(sock)
'' ```

'' This example creates a simple TCP server that listens on port 8080 and responds to client connections.

'' For previewing output, you can use `PRINT` to output data to the console or use a GUI library like `fbGFX` or `fbTk` to create a graphical interface.

'' Do you have specific questions about creating servers or previewing output in FreeBasic?
